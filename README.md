## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **WebRTC**: simple-peer
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Backend**: Express + WebSocket (ws)

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Mobile browsers with WebRTC support

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure both the signaling server and development server are running
- Check that your firewall allows WebSocket connections
- For production deployment, ensure WebSocket connections are properly proxied

### Camera/Microphone Access
- Grant permissions when prompted by the browser
- Check browser settings if permissions were previously denied
- Some browsers require HTTPS for camera access in production

### Peer Connection Failures
- The application uses Google's public STUN servers
- For production use, consider adding TURN servers for better connectivity

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder and `server.js` to your hosting provider
3. Ensure WebSocket connections are supported and properly configured
4. Use HTTPS for secure connections and camera access
